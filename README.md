# LaTeX template for abstract submissions to mFiL

Here you can find a `.tex` template for abstract submissions to mFiL.
To use the template, you will need the `mfil-abstract-template-latex.tex`. A file like `mfil-sample-bibliography.bib` may be used to store your references and pull them from in the `.tex` file.
