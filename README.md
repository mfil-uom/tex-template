# LaTeX template for abstract submissions to mFiL

Here you can find a `.tex` template for abstract submissions to mFiL.
To use the template, you will need `mfil-abstract-template-latex.tex` and the `sp.bst` file which is the bibliography style to be used for your submission.

If you are using BibTeX remember to change the name of the `.bib` file in `\bibliography{<your-bib>}`.
If you are not using BibTeX, remove all the relevant lines.
